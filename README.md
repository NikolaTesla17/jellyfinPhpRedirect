# jellyfinPhpRedirect
 A simple redirect script to help you not burn through your data cap when streaming.
 The point of this script is to simply run a basic php script that redirects your browser either to the local server ip if it you are an ip previously said to be your home ip, or to a public ip if the user is accesing from an ip said to be an away ip. It also has logic for designating an ip as home or away using a very snazy web page.
